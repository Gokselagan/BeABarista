                        Ready-made ground coffee or coffee beans sold for Turkish coffee are usually of Brazilian origin. This type of bean, known as Rio Minas, constitutes 90% of Turkish coffee.

                        Turkish coffee is one of the oldest methods of preparing and brewing coffee that has come from the Ottoman Empire to today, playing a significant role in Turkish culture. It has a unique identity and tradition with its distinctive taste, foam, aroma, and presentation. It is the only type of coffee served with its grounds.

                    <ol>
                        <li align="left">First, two teaspoons of Turkish coffee are placed into the cezve (a special pot) for each cup. It is important that the coffee is as freshly ground as possible; we do not recommend using coffee that has been stored for a long time or has become moist in an open container.</li>
                        <li align="left">Then, add enough water for each cup. It is also important to use drinking water. Chlorinated tap water can spoil the taste of your coffee. If you want your coffee to be frothier, it is recommended to use water from the refrigerator.</li>
                        <li align="left">Next, add sugar cubes or granulated sugar according to the desired level of sweetness. Everyone's sugar preference for Turkish coffee is different. While no sugar is added to plain coffee, half a cube is added for lightly sweetened coffee, one cube for moderately sweetened coffee, and two cubes for sweetened coffee.</li>
                        <li align="left">After arranging everything and placing it in the cezve, stir all the ingredients well before putting them on the stove. The spoon, like the coffee, should also be free of moisture.</li>
                        <li align="left">The next important detail is to cook the coffee over low heat. If it is cooked over high heat, it may boil quickly without absorbing its essence. Therefore, coffee cooked over embers is the best. Another important detail is not to stir it after putting it on the stove, as stirring can prevent the formation of foam.</li>
                        <li align="left">The coffee is removed from the heat when it reaches the boiling point, as the foam may recede if left too long. However, the coffee is not immediately poured into the cups after being removed from the heat. First, the foam that has accumulated on top is distributed to the cups with a spoon, and then it is put back on the heat. On its next boil, the cups are filled halfway, mostly with foam.</li>
                        <li align="left">Finally, when it boils again, the coffee is equally distributed into the cups. It is important to pour the coffee from the side of the cup. Pouring directly in the center can disperse the foam, preventing you from achieving the desired frothy appearance.</li>
